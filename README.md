# FinTrack_Winner_EXT 💸🤖  
*A financial assistant powered by AI – HackUAB 2025 Winner Edition*

---

This is an extension of that project, with improvements and a more complete backend implementation. It was born from my desire to consolidate what I learned in recent courses on Docker and Generative AI, which inspired me to revisit and enhance the original code.

## 🌟 Overview

**FinTrack** was born from the need to help individuals, especially those with limited financial literacy, understand and manage their money in a safe and informed way.

This project combines AI, automation, and financial education in a chatbot-powered tool that provides smart recommendations, tracks expenses, and verifies the safety of online shopping websites.

## 🔍 What It Does

- 📊 **Tracks expenses and income** via a simple backend system  
- 🤖 **Analyzes user financial behavior** using Perplexity AI  
- 🌍 **Gives country-aware saving tips** based on user origin  
- 🛡️ **Evaluates website trustworthiness** via Trustpilot (Selenium)  
- 🧾 **Visualizes available payment methods** by region *(planned)*  
- 🧠 **Delivers a chatbot experience** to assist users with financial questions  

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

The system is modular and divided into:

### 🎨 Design  
- UX/UI mockups created with **Figma**  
- Friendly financial assistant mascot: **Fin**

### 🤖 AI Chatbot  
- Uses **Perplexity API** to generate real-time financial advice  
- Incorporates user origin data (e.g., country) for contextual responses  
- Structured prompts simulate a smart and warm assistant

### 🔐 Website Reputation Checker  
- Built with **Selenium + Trustpilot** to assess if a website is secure or risky for online purchases

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Integrating AI into real use cases like financial advice  
- Structuring a backend app under pressure during a Hackathon  
- Handling APIs, scraping with Selenium, and separating code cleanly  
- Never giving up when tools fail, always look for alternative solutions
